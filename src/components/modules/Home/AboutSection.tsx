            ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Shamyun Ahmed Iâ€™m an aspiring Full-Stack Developer with
            a passion for building fast, clean, and user-focused web
            experiences. I love solving problems through code â€” whether itâ€™s
            crafting interactive UIs with Next.js, designing robust backends
            with Express & Prisma, or optimizing database queries in PostgreSQL.
            Currently, Iâ€™m exploring advanced fullstack development, machine
            learning, and system design â€” aiming to become a versatile engineer
            who can build across web, mobile, and AI-powered systems.

              ðŸš€ My Goals:
            </h3>
            <p>
              I aim to build software that not only works well but feels right â€”
              intuitive, efficient, and elegant. Iâ€™m currently focused on
              improving my fullstack and database skills, and Iâ€™m planning to
              pursue a Computer Science or Engineering degree abroad. In the
              long term, I want to combine my skills in AI, Web, and Robotics to
              create intelligent systems that make peopleâ€™s lives easier. ðŸ§­
              Beyond Code When Iâ€™m not programming, youâ€™ll find me reading
              mythology-inspired fiction, exploring new ideas in economics and
              physics, or diving into tech projects that challenge how I think.
